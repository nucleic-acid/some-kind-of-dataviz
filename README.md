# Some Kind of Datavisualization
This repository collects and analyzes data on the phrases "some (kind|sort|form|type) of", or "of some (kind|sort|form|type)" spoken across StarTrek Series.

This little ongoing project is inspired by the hosts of the ["Trek am Dienstag" podcast](https://trekamdienstag.de), who mentioned a [Supercut](https://youtu.be/JwZiezIxCVU) of all of these phrases in StarTrek Voyager.

The transcript data is accessed via the `{rtrek}` package. Thanks to its [author](https://github.com/leonawicz) for making this possible!
